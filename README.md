# HuggingChatInDjangoDemo

caveats:
It is not recommended to use the Generative AI product using vanilla restful API that relies on HTTP. So, make it a streamline/promise/asynchronous/sockets or you name that.

```json
{
  "question": "Hello, can you describe about yourself, what is HuggingChat?",
  "response": " Hello! I'm HuggingChat, a large language model trained by the research organization Hugging Face. My purpose is to assist with answering questions, providing information, and engaging in conversation on a wide range of topics.\n\nI was built using a technique called transformer-based machine learning, which allows me to understand and generate human-like text based on the input I receive. I have been trained on a diverse array of internet text, so I can provide responses that are both informative and conversational. However, please note that while I strive for accuracy, I don't have access to real-time or personal data unless it has been shared with me in the course of our conversation. I am also not capable of forming opinions or beliefs; I simply aim to provide helpful and respectful responses based on the information I've been given."
